# sentinel3-altimetry-l2
Toolbox for sentinel-3 altimetry level2 product processing
## 1. Introduction
This repository is built for the radar/sar altimetry data processing. this repository contains folders as follows:
1) notebook: basic workflow for main processing.
2) utils: .py file corresponding to the processing functions built in this repo.
## 2. Features
1) we construct a 1d-cnn (1 dimentional convolutional neural network) model for the ocean-like waveform recognition.
2) we use ransac algorithm for the elevation values filterd and prediction.
